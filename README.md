# Forest Fire Detection with Audio CNN

## About
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for audio classification. The model processes audio clips and classifies them on whether it can detect sounds of forest fires in them. The aim was to deploy this on a low compute device.

The implementation is inspired by the paper: [**Fight Fire with Fire: Detecting Forest Fires with Embedded Machine Learning Models Dealing with Audio and Images on Low Power IoT Devices**](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/2/783).  

## How to Use
1. **Clone the notebook** to Colab.  
2. **Install dependencies** (PyTorch & Numpy )
3. **Download the dataset** used for training/testing: [Authors' Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15PQ-my8cA1blUIbAGRY8Jhq_d8Z7qim7/view).  
4. **Prepare the dataset** as required by the notebook (split the data as per the instructions given in the paper).  
5. **Run the notebook cells** sequentially to train the CNN & evaluate its performance.
